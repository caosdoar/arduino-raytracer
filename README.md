Why?
----

As a kid I had fantasied with building my own handle console. 
I decided to buy an small screen for arduino to reencounter with that dreams.

As a game programmer try to make a raytracer looked like the obvious first 
application to test. So there it is.

To Do
-----

If you are interesting in extend this here it is a list of missing features:
- Materials (just using a colour right now)
- More complex lighting (only diffuse lighting now)
- Coloured light
- Multiple lights
- Shadows
- Make it run at 60fps
- Add a second screen and create an oculus rift competitor
